See that heart?
That is your SOUL,
the very culmination of your being!

Your SOUL starts off 
weak, but can grow 
strong if you gain 
a lot of LV.

What's LV stand for?
Why, LOVE, of course!

You want some
LOVE, don't you?

Don't worry,
I'll share some 
with you!

Down here, LOVE is shared through

Little white...
"friendliness
pellets."

Are you ready?

[]

Hey buddy,
you missed them.

Let's try again,
okay?


You idiot.

In this world, it's
kill or BE killed.

Why would ANYONE pass 
up an opportunity 
like this!?

Die.

*pew*

What a terrible
creature, torturing
such a poor,
innocent youth...

Ah, do not be 
afraid, my child.

I am TORIEL, 
caretaker of 
the RUINS.

I pass through this 
place every day to 
see if anyone has 
fallen down.

You are the first
human to come here
in a long time.

Come!
I will guide you 
through the 
catacombs.
